# OMDB Movie Search

In this project I crate a React app that does search movies using https://omdbapi.com/ API,it will search for all titles matching user input and displays UI based on output from said API.

This project was Implemented using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),[Type Script](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). I used TDD approach for this project and used [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end tests.
